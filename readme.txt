Discover a world without responsive image problems. RIU simplifies every front-end developer’s life by solving every image size problem.


== Description ==

RIU fixes image problems, caused by mobile device and screen resolution diversity, such as accessibility, quality, maintenance and SEO. RIU keeps your subject in focus so that your message is always received by the viewers.

= How does it work ? =

By resizing and moving the image as a background property, in order to track and maintain the subject in focus, no matter the image size or its aspect ratio. 
To do this, RIU must use an “area of focus” (AOF) and “point of focus”(POF), relevant for each image.
AOF and POF are values provided by users and coordinated with the image subject. 
RIU will automatically adjust the final result, on all devices where the content is available, based on

* image aspect ratio
* container size 
* aspect ratio
* AOF, POF
* image size

= Features =

* Intelligent responsive images
* Targeted cropping
* Image subject is always first
* Preserve the image subject to fit perfect on your responsive web design no matter the aspect ratio or size
* Easy to understand and use

It blends directly on WordPress media gallery so for the moment you can activate it right there. 

*The JavaScript part of RIU was independently designed and will remain as individual as possible. This feature ensures the possibility of using RIU on any non WordPress base projects with minimal developer intervention.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If the installation was correct, this might occur due to the fact that the custom theme you are using was not developed using Wordpress best practices, in order to load RIU javascript's and shortcode.
